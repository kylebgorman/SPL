Hiatic shortening
=================

* \emph{vocalis ante vocalem corriptur}
* Moraic interpretation due to Zirin 1970

Hiatus or diphthong?
====================

* At least a claim that rising sonority sequences were always hiatic...
* Meadows 1946, 1948 also

A line with lots of dactyls
===========================

quadrupedante      putrem  sonitū    quatit  ungula   campum   (\emph{Aeneid}, VIII.596)

A line with lots of spondees
============================

|im.mu:|nem/to:|to:mul|ti:/prae|sta:bimus|aiwo:|
immūnem     tōtō   multī   praestābimus   aevō                 (\emph{Pharsalia}, VI.764)

Hypermeter
==========
* \emph{synapheia}: shortening of verse-final vowel before a verse-initial vowel
* \emph{hypermeter}: the resulting (shortened) verse
* Almost always \emph{-que}: Goold suggests it was simply pronounced [k].

Elision
=======
* \emph{prodelision}: elision of initial vowel in \emph{es}, \emph{est}, and \emph{et}

Writing
=======

* Two oft-discussed characteristics of classical poetry which are of limited relevance to phonological analysis are \emph{caesura}, which refers to a pause between words, and \emph{ictus}, or the ``beat'' associated with the most prominent syllable of a metrical foot---in dactylic hexameter the first syllable---which need not coincide with word stress.
