Hiatic shortening
=================

* \emph{vocalis ante vocalem corriptur}
* Moraic interpretation due to Zirin 1970

Hiatus or diphthong?
====================

* At least a claim that rising sonority sequences were always hiatic...
* Meadows 1946, 1948 also

A line with lots of dactyls

Hypermeter
==========
* \emph{synapheia}: shortening of verse-final vowel before a verse-initial vowel
* \emph{hypermeter}: the resulting (shortened) verse
* Almost always \emph{-que}: Goold suggests it was simply pronounced [k].

Elision
=======
* \emph{prodelision}: elision of initial vowel in \emph{es}, \emph{est}, and \emph{et}

Writing
=======

* Two oft-discussed characteristics of classical poetry which are of limited relevance to phonological analysis are \emph{caesura}, which refers to a pause between words found mid-verse, and \emph{ictus}, the ``beat'' associated with the most prominent position of a metrical foot (in dactylic metres, the first syllable)---classical poets sought to construct lines so that ictus and word stress were opposed.
